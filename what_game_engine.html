            A game engine is like a tool box, it has all the features and tools you need you need to make a game. <br>
            It has all of the code, objects, textures, models, ect that are in your game. Not only is this the place where you store all your resources, <br>
            its also the place where you put everything together. Lets say you made a 3D model of a character, and know need to import it. <br>
            You would probably import your model into the engine and then code your character in the engine. But there are a whole lot of engines to choose from. <br>
            <br><i><b>What Game Engine should I use?</b></i> <br>
            Choosing a game engine all depends on what games you want to make. If you are more experienced proggraming in C#, Then you might want to check out Unity. <br>
            Unity is a 3D and 2D game engine that has alot of games made with it such as Cuphead, Among Us, Hollow Knight, and many others. <br>
            The engine also uses the proggraming languge C#. <br>
            If you are interested in higher end graphics for your game you should consider using Unreal Engine. <br>
            Unreal is know for its amazing graphics and has a good suite of games under its belt such as Sea of Thieves, Borderlands 3, Rocket leaque, ect. <br>
            Unreal Engine uses C++ and is definetly made and used for more AAA titles. (AAA meaning made by large companies creating games.) But can be used for indipendint titles. <br>
            <br><i><b>What Game Engine is this site focusing on?</b></i> <br>
            This website is going to be focusing on the OpenSrc game engine called Godot. <br>
            Godot is a very powerful game engine that is always growing due to it being OpenSrc. <i>"What is OpenSrc?"</i> you might ask. <br>
            OpenSrc means that the source code of Godot is open to anyone. Any person can change how the engine works and add new features. They can then upload <br>
            these features to Godot for others to use. This makes Godot always growing and getting better. Godot is great for 2D and 3D games and uses <br>
            GDscript (which is just a mixed version of Squirrel, Lua, and Python) and C#. It is a new engine in the spotlight and has a few known titles like <br>
            Buckshot Roulette, Endoparasitic, and Brotato. Continue with the button below to get introdiced to Godot a bit more.
