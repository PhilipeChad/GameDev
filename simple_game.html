    <h1>A Simple Game to Get Started</h1>
    <p>
        (PLEASE READ THE INTRO TO GODOT PAGE FIRST) <br>
        Once you have created your project and you are familiar with the Godot Engine layout we can make <br>
        a simple game where you can walk around, jump, and collect coins. It will be very simple so that you can get the <br>
        idea of how to do simple things in Godot. <br>
        <br><i><b>Creating the Player</b></i> <br>
        The first thing we need to do is create a player. Because you are probably a begginer, We will be using the default <br>
        player script. Lets create the player scene now. Select OTHER NODE in the object tree.
        <br> <img src="tutImage4.png" alt="godot screen" width="1250"> <br>
        Once you select that, this screen should pop up. 
        <br> <img src="tutImage5.png" alt="godot image"> <br>
        This is where you choose what kind of object you want to create. <br>
        In Godot, we do this with nodes. Nodes are the building blocks of games in Godot. Because we are doing a player we will <br>
        use the CharacterBody3D node. To find it, search for it in the search bar and it should pop up. MAKE SURE ITS 3D AND NOT 2D. <br>
        <br> Once you do that you should see the CharacterBody3D node in the object tree. You should now rename your CharacterBody3D <br>
        to Player by double clicking it to make it more clear. <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage6.png" alt="godot image"> <br>
        Now you should save the scene. You can save it by right-clicking on the scene that indicates is is not saved and selecting SAVE SCENE. This screen should now pop up. <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage8.png" alt="godot image"> <br>
        This is where you will name your scene and also where you want to save it in your file system. But we currently <br>
        dont have any other items in the file-system so just name your scene in the FILE box at the bottom of the window. You can name this whatever you want but I reccomend "player" <br>
        and click SAVE. Your scenes are now saved. Now some of you are wondering why we are making the player a seperate scene and not <br>
        making it inside a scene with a level. Well in godot we have something called "Scene Instancing." <br>
        Scene Instancing is a way to orginize your game better and more efficiently. Instead of making a bunch of coins in a level scene, you would make <br>
        a coin scene with a single coin and make a Level scene and then put the coin scene inside of the level scene. Its okay if that is a little confusing we will get <br>
        more into that a bit later. Now lets finish up the player. Now as you can see we have no player object, so lets add one now. <br>
        <br>
        To add one right click on the Player node. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="tutImage6.png" alt="tut image"> <br>
        A drop down menu should pop up and then select ADD CHILD NODE, this will add a child node the player. Now the same window from before will pop up. <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage5.png" alt="tut image"> <br>
        This time we want a MeshInstance3D. A MeshInstance3D is 3D shape that is very commanly used. <br>
        <br> Once you add it you will notice no shape. To add a shape go the Inspector and click MESH dropdown. <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage9.png" alt="tut image"> <br>
        Then a drop down will be displayed and you will see a bunch of different shapes. Select the capsule mesh. <br>
        You should now have a bean in you scene. But we need collision so the player doesnt fall through the floor. <br>
        To do this click MESH option at the top of the scene display. <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage10.png" alt="godot image"> <br>
        Then a dropdown will be displayed, select CREATE SIMPLIFIED CONVEX COLLISION SIBLING. <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage11.png" alt="godot image"> <br>
        You now have collision for the player. Now we have to get to scripting. <br>
        <br> <i><b>Scripting the Player</b></i> <br>
        <br>
        You can create a script in multiple different ways. But we are just going to add the script by selecting the player and <br>
        clicking on the add script icon, <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage12.png" alt="godot image"> <br>
        Now this screen should pop up, <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage13.png" alt="godot image"> <br>
        The LANGUGE option at the top is set to GDscript and thats what we will be using. the INHERITS option is what the script <br>
        will be based off of and in our case its the CharacterBody3D. Built in script will be off and it just makes it so the <br>
        script is built in, thats it. Under that is the PATH and that is where you want to store your script in the file-system. <br>
        And then there is TEMPLATE which is the CharacterBody3D template which we will be using. We dont need to change anything <br>
        unless you want to change the name of the script. Click create and this should now pop up. <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage14.png" alt="godot image"> <br>
        This is GDscript, it is very similar to python and C#. We will not be going into depth with scripting now but <br>
        we will later when we make the coins.
        The two top parts of the script are the players speed and jump velocity. They have CONST at the beggining <br>
        which means the value cant be changed. Below that is the gravity, it has VAR at the beggining which means it can be <br>
        changed later on in the code. This code is a bit more complex so I wont go much into it but we will be scripting a little later. <br>
        Now we must create the level. <br>
        <br> <i><b>Creating the Level</b></i> <br>
        To start creating the level we are going to create a new scene. To do that click the plus icon by the player scene. <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage15.png" alt="godot image"> <br>
        And this time we are going to be using a 3D Node. A 3D Node is just a base 3D node. Think of it kinda like a folder for 3D Objects. <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage16.png" alt="godot image"> <br>
        Now rename the Node 3D just like you renamed the player (double clicking) then call it "Level." <br>
        Now save the scene and we can now get to building the level. The first thing we need is a floor, <br>
        to do that we will add a MeshInstance3D with a PLANE MESH. You can also rename it if you want. <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage17.png" alt="godot image"> <br>
        Now we should scale it up to make it larger. To do that click on the scale tool. <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage18.png" alt="godot image"> <br>
        And now drag the cubes to scale the plane. <br>
        Now we should add a material so it looks a bit more like grass. To do that click on the MESH dropdown in the Inspector. <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage19.png" alt="godot image"> <br>
        Now click on the Material dropdown <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage20.png" alt="godot"> <br>
        Now click New Standerd Material 3D. Now click on the Albedo option then COLOR and change the color to what ever you like. <br>
        Now we should add the collision. We will do it the same way we did it last time, click on the mesh icon and then click <br>
        Create Trimesh Static Body. Now lets add the player scene to the level scene. Go to your file system and drag the player scene into the object tree. <br>
        Move it around so it is sitting above the floor. Now we can test our player movement out. Click on the run option at the top of the screen. <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage21.png" alt="godot"> <br>
        But when you run it you cant see anything. To fix that we need camera and lighting. To add a camera add a node to the level scene <br>
        and search for Camera3D. When you add it move it back and up a little so you can see the entire floor. But you will notice <br>
        when you run it its very dark. To add light to the level click on the three dots icon and click "Add Enviorment To Scene" and "Add Sun To Scene." <br>
        You can now run around on a platform with lighting. Now we need to make and script the coins. <br>
        <br> <i><b>Creating the Coins</b></i> <br>
        To start making the coins we are going to create a new scene and then selecting OTHER NODE like before. <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage4.png" alt="godot image"> <br>
        And then adding a MeshInstance3D to the scene and giving it a Sphere mesh and also shrinking it down a bit. <br>
        Now rename the MeshInstance3D to "coin" and save the scene like you did with the level and player scene. Also give the sphere a yellow color like we did with the grass. <br>
        Now we are going to add an Area3D Node. An Area3D Node is very good at detecting collision and is what we are going to <br>
        use for detecting the player toutching the coin. Add a child Node to the coin mesh and search for Area3D and then add it. <br>
        But we also need to add a CollisionShape3D as a child of the Area3D so we can difine the collisons shape. So add a <br>
        child to the Area3D node and search for CollisionShape3D and add it. <br>
        Then click the SHAPE dropdown <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage22.png" alt="godot image"> <br>
        and selecting New Box Shape3D. <br>
        Now you have a collision detection but now we need to create a script for the coin. Do that and name it "coin" and make sure the TEMPLATE is Node: Default. <br>
        Now we need to refrence the collisoin. To do that we will use <i>@onready</i> which will access the object when the scene runs. <br>
        So at the top of the code below where it says extends, write @onready. Now we need to create a variable to store the object, <br>
        so after @onready type <i>var.</i> Now name the variable "collision" and make sure to type by the "var". Now type "=" so we now can define the value of the variable <br>
        and drag the Area3D node from the object tree to the "=" and you now have a access to the Node. <br>
        Now delete the ready and proccess functions. Your script should now look like this. <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage23.png" alt="godot image"> <br>
        Now under the variable we are going to create a physics proccess function. A physics proccess function is a function that runs every frame. In order <br>
        to create one first type in <b>func</b>, and then type out <b>_physics proccess</b> and it should pop up as one of the options. Now hit enter and you will see <br>
        that is will autamaticly indent the code. If you are ever writing code inside an func, if, for, ect. Then make sure it is indented under that line of code. <br>
        Now we need to check if the player is toutching the coin using collision. To do that we will use a <b>if</b> statement. <br>
        An <b>if</b> statement checks if a certain statement is true. Stuff like if a variable has the value of 5 or something like that. <br>
        We will use it to check if the collider is toutching the player. To do that type <i>if</i> inside of the physics proccess so it checks it every frame. <br>
        Now we will type the variable we declared later. So type the name (I named mine <i>collision</i>) and then type a dot. <br>
        We type a dot to access an objects properties. So we are typing a dot by the collision variable name to access the <br>
        collisions properties. Now we are going to type a function that is only for Area3D's. <i><b>has_overlapping_bodies</b></i>. <br>
        has_overlapping_bodies is function that checks if the Area3D is overlapping with a collisoin body, which our player has. <br>
        Now type a collan. We use a collan after any if, func, for, ect. Now hit enter. Remember if you are typing inside of any statement make sure it is indented below it. <br>
        Now we want the coin to hide so just type "hide()" which will hide the object. <br>
        This is what your code should look like. <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage24.png" alt="godot image"> <br>
        Now that we have a working script we need to put the coins into the level scene. You probably remember but the coin scene should be dragged into the level scene. <br>
        <br> <img src="tutImage25.png" alt="godot"> <br>
        Make sure you move the coin above the floor and duplicate multiple of them around and boom you made a game. Now this game is very bare bones and only <br>
        utilizes just a little the Godot Engine has to offer. But those simple things you just learned will be used and will help you even after you learn more complex <br>
        functionalities. But thats it for a (very) simple game to get started.
